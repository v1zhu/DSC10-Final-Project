**Friends Reboot Analysis - Principles of Data Science (DSC 10)**  

**Project Overview**   
This project applies introductory data science techniques to explore and analyze datasets from the TV show Friends. Using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook, I cleaned, organized, and analyzed episode, dialogue, and emotion data to inform decisions for a modern reboot of the series.  

The project answers open-ended questions using real-world datasets and demonstrates data manipulation, visualization, and interpretation skills developed throughout the DSC 10 course.

**Key Objectives**  
Identify standout directors and writers from the original series  
Examine gender balance in speaking roles  
Analyze emotional expression across main characters  
Explore relationship dynamics and story themes  
Generate new episode titles  
Recommend an optimal number of episodes for a reboot  

**Skills Demonstrated**    
Data cleaning and wrangling  
Dataset merging, filtering, and aggregation  
Exploratory data analysis  
Visualization using matplotlib  
Insight generation from real-world data  
Reproducible analysis in Jupyter Notebook  

**Data Sources**  
All datasets are based on a Kaggle Friends dataset, preprocessed for educational use.  
episodes.csv: Episode metadata (season, title, air date, views, ratings, etc.)  
lines.csv: Character dialogue lines  
emotions.csv: Labeled emotions per line  

**Course Context**  
This project was completed as the final assignment in DSC 10: Principles of Data Science at UC San Diego. It combines key concepts from the quarter into a real-world, open-ended analysis task.
